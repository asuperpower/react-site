With its strong flavour and soft texture, nothing hits the spot better
than a freshly baked slice of garlic bread. While it's not too difficult 
to make a good loaf of garlic bread, taking it to the next level can take
quite a few different tricks. There are decisions along the way to make,
and one is how much to melt the butter. You see, some recipes call for
unmelted butter as the texture of slightly softened butter is ideal for
garlic bread. But in this case, it is hard to incorporate a strong garlic
flavour. Some recipes use a 'hybrid' approach, brushing melted butter with
garlic and then softened butter on top. I would like to introduce a better
approach: melting the butter and then using xanathan gum to thicken the 
butter to the desired texture.

Xanathan gum is an interesting cooking ingredient. It allows you to change
the thickness of a liquid similar to cornstarch without contributing to the
flavour in the same way.
[It is useful in salad dressings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8N_VNmXNb4)
where you don't want to cook the dressing in the same way that you would need
to with corn starch. It also
