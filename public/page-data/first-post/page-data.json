This sort of\nwork requires a unique design to be done every time — for example, we\ncan't reuse the same high-level protocol to communicate between two\nsets of software that have completely different requirements.  </p>\n<p>To complicate matters, it is often the case where these need to be\ndesigned carefully, and any mistake made could cause a lot of time\nlost or structural problems down the road. </p>\n<p>Checklists curb this issue by providing a standard roadmap of work\nas well as preventing common problems that can arise during the\nprocess of design. Importantly, this applies to a wide range of\ndesign engineering tasks. A checklist can be used for designing\nprotocols, board design, making database tables and even\nimplementing a new manufacturing process.</p>\n<h3>An example</h3>\n<p>To work through the protocol idea highlighted earlier, a simple checklist\nfor designing a protocol is:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Is there a protocol that already fits my needs (Y/N)  </li>\n<li>\n<p>☐ Work out format (Binary OR Textual)<br>\nIf binary:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Select big or little-endian<br>\nIf textual:  </li>\n<li>☐ Camel case or snake case?  </li>\n<li>☐ Work out a format (JSON/YAML/XML?)  </li>\n<li>☐ Work out limits (max string lengths, etc)  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>☐ Work out security (Is encryption required?)  </li>\n<li>\n<p>☐ Decide if there are timing requirements  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Do we need a heartbeat?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>☐ Decide if it is stateless<br>\nIf there are states:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>☐ Work out states  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These sort of checklists are crucially not set in stone. Sometimes, while\nworking through them, you will need to reorder what you do. It's also likely\nthat you'll learn and make improvements so the checklist a year later could\nbe a lot different from what you started with. It also helps with making\nconsistent decisions. Because we already decided that the protocol is to be\neither binary or textual up-front, we aren't going to make a hybrid of the\ntwo when we design it, as we have already decided to use a specific type in\nthe design. To follow on from this idea, it can help when reviewing others'\nwork, as you can quickly see any issues in the design.</p>\n<h3>Other uses</h3>\n<p>Another area where checklists are important is board design. In an\nenvironment where it can take weeks to see the results of a new design,\nthere is a big cost to design flaws. While software (such\nas Altium's design rules) may go a long way in checking the validity of the\nboard, it does not completely discount the benefits of following a <a href=\"https://resources.altium.com/p/pcb-design-review-checklist-gets-you-manufacturing-quickly\">good\ndesign review checklist</a>. </p>\n<p>These checklists can be either personal or done for an organisation — it is\nuseful in an organisation where multiple engineers may benefit from it.\nThere is additionally the added benefit of a 'group IQ' where multiple\npeople can contribute to one checklist.</p>\n<p>Checklists are an important tool in a design engineers arsenal and\ncan simplify similar tasks that have unique constraints. They also prevent\ncostly mistakes and can be shared to improve the reliability of design in\nan organisation. They can also be used in a wide variety of engineering\ndisciplines, from hardware through to mechanical and software design.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Importance of Checklists in Design Engineering","date":"November, 03, 2020","path":"/first-post","tags":["checklists","design","engineering","software","firmware"],"excerpt":"In the field of design engineering, there are always new challenges which involve what are often similar pieces of work.
